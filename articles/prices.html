                <p class="inside-box">OpenAPI provides three different resources for getting prices. The resources are called Prices, InfoPrices and OptionChain. A price is a large collection of values and attributes and if possible it's recommended that only those needed are requested. Prices are provided based on instruments which are defined by a combination of a Uic and an AssetType parameter (read more about instruments here).</p>
                <p class="inside-box">If the purpose is just to get a price, InfoPrices offers a request/response interface for a single price as well as a list of prices for a single AssetType. The Prices are intended for trading and works through setting up a subscription and getting values back on the streaming channel.</p>
